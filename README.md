# MUBD-DecoyMaker 3.0: Making Maximal Unbiased Benchmarking Data Sets with Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

MUBD-DecoyMaker 3.0 is a brand-new computational software to make Maximal Unbiased Benchmarking Data Sets (MUBD) for in silico screening. Compared with our earlier two versions, i.e. MUBD-DECOYMAKER (Pipeline Pilot-based version, or MUBD-DecoyMaker 1.0) and MUBD-DecoyMaker 2.0, MUBD-DecoyMaker 3.0 has two noteworthy features:

1. Virtual molecules generated by recurrent neural netwrok (RNN)-based molecular generator with reinforcement learning (RL), instead of chemical library molecules, constitue the unbiased decoy set (UDS) component of MUBD. 

2. The criteria (or rule) for an ideal decoy previously defined in the earlier versions are integrated into a new scoring function for RL to fine-tune the generator.


Below is how to implement and run MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0.

## Requirements

As [REINVENT](https://github.com/MolecularAI/Reinvent) is used to make virtual decoys of MUBD 3.0, users are required to install the `conda` environment `reinvent.v3.2`. Please note we have modified the packages `reinvent_chemistry` and `reinvent_scoring` here in order to include our scoring functions specific for MUBD:
1) Clone this repository and navigate to it.
2) Merge modifications to original `reinvent_chemistry` and `reinevnt_scoring` :
```
$ cp -r reinvent_chemistry/ reinvent_scoring/ ~/anaconda3/envs/reinvent.v3.2/lib/python3.7/site-packages
```
create a `conda` environment called `MUBD3.0` (for preprocessing and postprocessing): 
```
$ conda env create -f MUBD3.0.yml
```

## Usage

`ACM Agonists` is used as a test case to demonstrate how build MUBD-ACM-AGO data set with MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0. All the related files are freely accessible to in `resources`. 

### Get unbiased ligand set (ULS)
Run `get_ligands.py` to process the raw ligand set. This script takes raw ligands in the representation of SMILES `raw_actives.smi` as input and outputs unbiased ligand set `Diverse_ligands.csv`. Another four property profiles `Diverse_ligands_PS.csv`, `Diverse_ligands_PS_maxmin.csv`, `Diverse_ligands_sims_maxmin.txt` and `Diverse_ligands_len.txt` are also recorded. Please use the `--cure` option to preprocess the SMILES if no curation is performed before.
```
$ conda activate MUBD3.0
(MUBD3.0) $ python get_ligands.py
```

### Generate virtual decoys

`mk_config.py` writes out the configuration for MUBD3.0 virtual decoy generation. In order to automatically set up the configuration for each ligand and proceed to the next ligand, we provide `gen_decoys.sh`. Please replace the `</path/to/REINVENT>` and `</path/to/MUBD3.0>` in scripts with user defined directories.
```
$ mkdir output
$ chmod +x ./gen_decoys.sh
$ conda activate reinvent.v3.2
(reinvent.v3.2) $ ./gen_decoys.sh
```

### Get unbiased decoy set (UDS)
After decoy generation, each potential decoy set for `ligand_$idx` is stored in `output/ligand_$idx/results/scaffold_memory.csv`. Decoy refinement including SMILES curation and molecular clustering are performed to get unbiased decoy set `Final_decoys.csv`. We provide `process_decoys.sh` to automatically run `agglomerative_clustering.py` and `pool_decoys.py`.
```
$ chmod +x ./process_decoys.sh
$ conda activate MUBD3.0
(MUBD3.0) $ ./process_decoys.sh
```

## Validation
Basic validation is conducted based on four metrics. Please go through the notebook `basic_validation.ipynb` for more details.
```
$ conda activate MUBD3.0
(MUBD3.0) $ jupyter notebook
```
