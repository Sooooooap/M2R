# MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0: Debiasing Maximal Unbiased Benchmarking Data Sets with Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Introduction

MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0 is a brand new generation of MUBD-DECOYMAKER while its core algorithms are derived from [MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0](https://github.com/jwxia2014/MUBD-DecoyMaker2.0).Compared with past versions of MUBD-DECOYMAKER, MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0 has two major features:
1) Virtual molecules constitue the unbiased decoy set (UDS) which are generated by recurrent neural netwrok (RNN)-based molecular generator with reinforcement learning (RL).
2) Decoy filtering algorithms of MUBD-DECOYMAKER are designed as the scoring function for RL to fine tune the generator.

This open source repository provides the implementation of MUBD-DecoyMaker3.0.
